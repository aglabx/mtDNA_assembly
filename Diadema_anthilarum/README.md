# Assembly of Diadema antillarum mtDNA

## List of files:

Genome assembly: diadema_anthilarium_mtDNA.fasta

Genome annotation with MITOS: diadema_anthilarium_mtDNA.fasta

Genome visualization: genome.jpeg

Raw fastq data that supports the assembly extracted with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/ad3002/Cookiecutter): mtDNA_1.fastq.gz and mtDNA_2.fastq.gz

## Reproducibility instruction:

You can download the extracted mtDNA-positive reads and assemble them using any prokaryotic assembler such as SPAdes.
